This file describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data. The data needs to be unzipped as text files in the current working directory.

The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

ddply() from the plyr package is used to calculate means of the columns and based on the subject and activity subset, library needs to be loaded

Variables:
Original files, unzipped, downloaded files: x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test.

Merged datasets: all_data, all_labels and all_subjects are merged files of initial respective datasets (x to data, y to labels, subject to subjects) of each test and train sets.

Activities: contains variable name assigned to a number (1:6) from original provided activity_labels.txt file.
Features: contains the correct names for the all_data dataset measurements. 

MeanStdfeatures: is a numeric vector extracted from features, with numbers of rows which name contains mean or std. It is used to subset the merged data.  

final_data: is a merged dataset of all_data, all_labels and all_subjects merged together
mean_data contains the mean values for different measurements from final_data columns, sorted based on subject and activity
